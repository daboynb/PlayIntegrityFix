# What happened to Play integrity fix NEXT?

Chiteroman is keeping his module up to date with a lot of new things and improvements! So, I decided to create a module that downloads a working fingerprint instead of making a fork of his versions every time. This module is called 'playcurl,' and you simply need to install it alongside the official PIF.

The mechanism is the same; it will automatically pull a working fingerprint when the previous one gets banned.
